# Phase 1 Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: database/migration_phase1.sql
-- This will add the shapes and plan_layers tables with proper security
```

### 2. Environment Variables Check
Ensure these are set in your deployment environment:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
# Should complete with no errors
```

### 4. Security Headers (Optional)
Verify CSP headers in `middleware.ts` are appropriate for your domain.

## 📋 Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. API Endpoints Test
- [ ] `/api/enhanced` - Shape and layer operations
- [ ] `/api/plans` - Plan creation and management
- [ ] `/api/health` - Health check endpoint

### 2. UI Feature Test
- [ ] Enhanced toolbar loads correctly
- [ ] Drawing tools work (rectangle, circle, line, arrow, text, freehand)
- [ ] Layer management functions properly
- [ ] Canvas rendering with multiple layers
- [ ] Shape creation, editing, and deletion

### 3. Security Validation
- [ ] Input validation working (try invalid shapes)
- [ ] XSS protection active (test with malicious text)
- [ ] Rate limiting functional (excessive requests)
- [ ] Database RLS enforced

### 4. Performance Check
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Drawing responsiveness < 100ms
- [ ] API response time < 200ms
- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended use

## 🔍 Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **API Response Times**
   - Shape operations
   - Layer management
   - Drawing updates

2. **Error Rates**
   - Validation failures
   - Database errors
   - Client-side exceptions

3. **User Experience**
   - Drawing tool usage
   - Layer management activity
   - Session duration

### Recommended Tools
- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry or similar
- **Performance Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics or New Relic
- **Database Monitoring**: Supabase built-in metrics
- **User Analytics**: Google Analytics or PostHog

## 🆘 Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback steps:

1. **Database Rollback**
   ```sql
   -- Remove new tables if needed:
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS shapes;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS plan_layers;
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**
   - Revert to previous commit
   - Remove enhanced API routes
   - Restore original whiteboard component

3. **Cache Clear**
   - Clear CDN cache
   - Clear browser cache for testing

## ✅ Success Criteria

Phase 1 deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All existing features continue to work
- [ ] New drawing tools are functional
- [ ] Layer management works correctly
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] Error rates remain below 1%

## 📞 Support Contacts

In case of deployment issues:
- **Database Issues**: Check Supabase dashboard
- **Build Issues**: Review Next.js build logs
- **Performance Issues**: Check Vercel/hosting provider metrics
- **Security Issues**: Review CSP reports and error logs
